	The mistletoe, to many people's surprise, is actually a parasitic plant that originated from Europe.
	It grows on willow, apple, and oak trees. They are only considered partial parasites, though, because they are still capable of completing photosynthesis. 
	Besides being a parasite, it is a common and traditional Christmas decoration.
	It is a tradition for two people to kiss under the mistletoe when they meet each other underneath it. </p>

<p> The original custom of kissing under the mistletoe comes from England. The tradition started with the rule that a berry must be picked from the sprig of the Mistletoe before anyone could be kissed. 
	It is important to note that you can not eat the berries, however, as they are poisonous.
	Once all the berries from the mistletoe were picked, there could be no more kissing underneath it.
